## 📁 Project Structure

The project is organized into several directories to maintain a clean and scalable codebase:

```

## ⚙️ How It Works

1.  **Data Simulation**: On application load, `services/data.ts` generates mock data for multiple KFC stores across different cities. This data includes ratings, sentiment, and historical search trends.
2.  **User Interaction**: The user selects one or two stores from the sidebar.
3.  **State Management**: React's `useState` hook manages the list of all stores and the currently selected stores.
4.  **AI Summary Generation**: When a store is selected for a detailed view, the `StoreView` component triggers the `generateStoreSummary` function.
5.  **Gemini API Call**: This function constructs a detailed prompt with the store's data (location, rating, sentiment, top keywords, and forecast trend) and sends it to the `gemini-2.5-flash` model via the `@google/genai` SDK.
6.  **Displaying Insights**: The AI-generated summary is streamed back and displayed in the "AI-Powered Summary" card, providing the user with concise, actionable insights.
7.  **Data Visualization**: `Recharts` is used to render interactive bar and line charts for city overviews and individual store trends.

## 🛠️ Setup and Running Locally

To run this project on your local machine, follow these steps:

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd <repository-directory>
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    # or
    yarn install
    ```

3.  **Set up environment variables:**
    Create a file named `.env` in the root of the project and add your Google Gemini API key:
    ```
    VITE_API_KEY=YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY
    ```
    *Note: The project is currently configured to use `process.env.API_KEY`. Depending on your build tool (like Vite), you may need to prefix the environment variable (e.g., `VITE_API_KEY`) and reference it as `import.meta.env.VITE_API_KEY` in the code.*

4.  **Start the development server:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    # or
    yarn dev
    ```

5.  Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5173` (or the address provided by your development server).
